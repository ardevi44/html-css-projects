# html y css intensivo

This repository was forked from [franklin369/cursohtmlcss](https://github.com/Franklin369/cursohtmlcss) wich is the source repo from [his course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-intensivo-de-html-y-css-camino-hacia-react/). This `course-development` branch contains just all my practice and features while passing the course. Wich is practically the same reseted code but with more simplier and semantic HTML and BEM practice in the css code, in some projects I add new features or some changes to my liking.

Most of the projects include Sass for the styles. This is my first aproach to this tecnology, so is not perfect but it's working.

Just in case, if you want to see all the demos, use vs code, clone the repository using the `course-development` branch and run the `index.html` file inside of each folder project with the [Live Server extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and there you have it.

## How did i compile the Sass files?

I used the [Live Sass Compiler extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) for this. Because there are just a copple files to deal with. Check the `settings.json` file on the `.vscode` folder to configure the extention and compile the files that you need, or delete its content and use the extention for compile all the sass content in all folders.
